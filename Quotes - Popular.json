            "I\u0027m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can\u0027t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don\u0027t deserve me at my best.  ― Marilyn Monroe",
            "Be yourself, everyone else is already taken. ― Oscar Wilde",
